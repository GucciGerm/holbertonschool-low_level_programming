This repository will be for the binary trees 0x1C
==================================================
Things we will be learning in this project:
- What is a binary tree?
- What is the difference between a binary tree and a binary search tree?
- What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked list?
- What are the depth, the height, and the size of a binary tree?
- What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree?
- What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree?
